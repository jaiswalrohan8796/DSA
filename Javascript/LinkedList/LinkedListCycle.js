var hasCycle = function (head) {
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;

// Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
// Output: true
// Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed)
